## Raafet Choukri

Senior business analyst and product manager in payments, based in Singapore.  
I work on crossborder payments, reference data and rule-driven validation, and I ship small Python tools for routing logic, ISO 20022 readiness and data quality.

## Focus

- SwiftRef and payment reference data (BIC, IBAN, LEI, clearing codes)
- Payment purpose-code rules and regulatory logic
- ISO 20022 payload structure and hybrid address parsing
- SSI routing, reachability and cut-off windows
- Deterministic QC checks, ETL pipelines and small REST/Streamlit front ends

## What I build

- Data-quality pipelines (Python, SQL, ETL, checksums, QC dashboards)
- ISO 20022 tools (payload validators, PPC rulesets, address-conversion prototypes)
- SSI and routing engines (graph search, cut-off management, reachability logic)
- vLEI and digital-identifier prototypes
- Streamlit front ends and simple APIs for demos and internal tools

## Active projects

- Corridor Ranking Engine – Python + SQLite optimiser for crossborder routes  
- Digital SSI – mapping SwiftRef fields to wallet coordinates and on-chain identifiers  
- Payment Purpose-Code Rules – unified global code lists and regulatory rules engine  
- EDS Onboarding Flow – sample microservice and GUI simulation for EPC VOP onboarding  
- ISO 20022 Address Converter – deterministic hybrid-address parser
