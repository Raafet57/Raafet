I work on crossborder payments, reference data and rule-driven validation.  
I build small Python tools for routing logic, ISO 20022 readiness and data quality.

### What I focus on
- BIC, IBAN, LEI and clearing-code mapping
- Purpose-code rules and regulatory logic
- ISO 20022 payload structure and hybrid address parsing
- SSI routing, reachability and cutoff windows
- Deterministic QC checks, ETL pipelines and small REST/Streamlit demos

### Current work

- Digital SSI prototype (identifier mapping for wallet rails)
- ISO 20022 address converter
- Purpose-code rules engine
- EDS onboarding flow microservice
